Hello! My name is Sam and I am a public health professional with functional expertise in data management, statistical analysis, and program evaluation. I have many years of experience working in global health, specifically in sexual/reproductive health and HIV prevention in low- and middle-income countries.

I received my BA in Geography from Vassar College, where I completed my thesis on the relationship between food and gentrification in Brooklyn, NY. I received my MPH from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health with a focus on Population Health and Applied Biostatistics. I completed a capstone project based on research conducted with the International Rescue Committee on adolescent reproductive health in crisis settings.

I am originally from Kentucky, but have lived in New York for over 10 years. I've found my quarantine home in Philadelphia and do not hate it!
